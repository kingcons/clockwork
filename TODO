TODO:
Fixup:
-- There are off-by-one errors in event-hour, event-minute, timezone and remind-me. WTH?
-- Event-date is returning nil. Shite.
Write get-reminder-time and get-event-time. Return local-time objects with timezone offsets with them.
TEST IT!
Contact us? (just a mailto:cl.ockwork.webdev@gmail.com maybe rather than a whole form...)

REMINDERS:
-- Note that we assume users will input the remind-date in the same timezone as the event-date. Remind them?
-- Remind users in the view that 160+ character messages will be split into several text messages and billed separately.

Phase2: MAKE IT MO PRETTIFUL!
-- Rewrite using new form-widget stuff.
---- Once send method is selected form changes to have the appropriate fields via AJAX.
-- Use CSS for labelless, side by side dropdowns for the time.
-- Clockwork art deco logo by one of my art friends?
-- Flesh out the homepage. About your data privacy? Reminder Successfully scheduled overlay/lightbox-ish-thing?
Phase3: MAKE IT MO FEATUROUS!
-- Confirmation email with link to delete reminders?
-- Add support for repeating events? (Daily,Weekly,Monthly,Yearly?)
-- This shouldn't happen but are we sure things are resilient to system clock changes? trivial-timers issue?
Phase4: MAKE IT MO ROBUSTERFIED!
-- Recover-reminders.

OPTIONALS:
Use the string-list and style types to make reminder class stricter?
