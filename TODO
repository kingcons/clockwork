TODO:
Add row and column support to textarea field-widget/presentation.

Phase2: MAKE IT MO PRETTIFUL!
-- Once send method is selected form changes to have the appropriate fields via AJAX.
-- CSS style or rewrite the 404 page.
-- Improve the main-content. Move into layout.lisp?
-- Style the everloving hell out of it. Make it look *good*.
---- What's the banner look like at 50%?
-- Use CSS for labelless, side by side dropdowns for the time.
Phase3: MAKE IT MO FEATUROUS!
-- jQuery overlay that can be called whenever to display arbitrary html.
-- Confirmation email with link to delete reminders. Send the link to (first reminder-emails). (send-unschedule-message)
---- TEST IT!
Phase4: MAKE IT MO ROBUSTERFIED!
-- What about network failures during send-email? Handle it!

OPTIONALS:
Use the string-list and style types to make reminder class stricter?
There's really no need for the with-encrypted-smtp macro. Replace with a function?
