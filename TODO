TODO:
Add row and column support to textarea field-widget/presentation.

REMINDERS:
-- Remind users in the view that 160+ character messages will be split into several text messages and billed separately?

Phase2: MAKE IT MO PRETTIFUL!
-- Use CSS for labelless, side by side dropdowns for the time.
-- Stop defining the height and width of the site-banner.
-- Flesh out the homepage. Talk about data privacy. Contact us? (just a mailto:cl.ockwork.webdev@gmail.com or overlay form?)
-- Overlay/lightbox-ish-thing on successful form submission to inform user.
-- Once send method is selected form changes to have the appropriate fields via AJAX.
Phase3: MAKE IT MO ROBUSTERFIED!
-- What about network failures during send-email? Handle it!
-- Provide fallback textfield if they don't use JS.
---- :Satisfies function needed in this case, too. "dd-mm-yyyy"
------ Regex OR split-sequence, then count elements and ensure each parses as
------ ints less than 32 and 13 and 9999, respectively. Check length 10 too?
Phase4: MAKE IT MO FEATUROUS!
-- Also, can we replace our extra headers in with-encrypted-smtp with :html-message t?
-- Confirmation email with link to delete reminders? Remember to add the link. What does this change about required fields?
---- Use a sha1 (maybe of the user's email and the OID) with a salt to generate a URI and set up a "selector" to handle it.
---- The selector will dispatch to a function that calls delete, thanks them for using the service and "deletes" the selector as it will never be called again.
---- The selector should be registered during reminder creation and both delete and send-and-delete should also remove it.
---- How do we know which timer is associated with the reminder being deleted? Use :name and object-ids?
-- Add support for repeating events? (Daily,Weekly,Monthly,Yearly?)
-- This shouldn't happen but are we sure things are resilient to system clock changes?
Add some simple logging for submissions, sends and deletions?
Add a Readme file (markdown?) that points to the CL Web Primer 1 article and mentions the need to add conf/config.lisp with a valid gmail email+pass.
-- The Readme should have a note about git update-index --assume-unchanged for the config file and also a note about calling recover-reminders in init.lisp.

OPTIONALS:
Use the string-list and style types to make reminder class stricter?
There's really no need for the with-encrypted-smtp macro. Replace with a function?
