TODO:
Figure out why the on-success function isn't firing.
-- Once send method is selected form changes to have the appropriate fields via AJAX.
-- Ensure that if a field isn't required, its validation (i.e. :satisfies) is only run when there is input.
Calendar presentation needs some CSS help because you can't see the next/prev month buttons.
TEST IT!
Contact us? (just a mailto:cl.ockwork.webdev@gmail.com maybe rather than a whole form...)
Add a Readme file (markdown?) that points to the CL Web Primer 1 article and mentions the need to add conf/confidential.lisp with a valid gmail email+pass.
-- The Readme should have a note about git update-index --assume-unchanged...

REMINDERS:
-- Note that we assume users will input the remind-date in the same timezone as the event-date. Remind them?
-- Remind users in the view that 160+ character messages will be split into several text messages and billed separately.

Phase2: MAKE IT MO PRETTIFUL!
-- Use CSS for labelless, side by side dropdowns for the time.
-- Clockwork art deco logo by one of my art friends?
-- Flesh out the homepage. About your data privacy? Reminder Successfully scheduled overlay/lightbox-ish-thing?
Phase3: MAKE IT MO ROBUSTERFIED!
-- Recover-reminders.
Phase4: MAKE IT MO FEATUROUS!
-- Confirmation email with link to delete reminders?
-- Add support for repeating events? (Daily,Weekly,Monthly,Yearly?)
-- This shouldn't happen but are we sure things are resilient to system clock changes? trivial-timers issue?

OPTIONALS:
Use the string-list and style types to make reminder class stricter?
