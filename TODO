TODO:
Add row and column support to textarea presentation.
Add some simple logging for submissions, sends and deletions?
Import make-timer and schedule-timer in defpackage?
Contact us? (just a mailto:cl.ockwork.webdev@gmail.com maybe rather than a whole form...)
Add a Readme file (markdown?) that points to the CL Web Primer 1 article and mentions the need to add conf/config.lisp with a valid gmail email+pass.
-- The Readme should have a note about git update-index --assume-unchanged...

REMINDERS:
-- Note that we assume users will input the remind-date in the same timezone as the event-date. Remind them?
-- Remind users in the view that 160+ character messages will be split into several text messages and billed separately.

Phase2: MAKE IT MO PRETTIFUL!
-- Use CSS for labelless, side by side dropdowns for the time.
-- Clockwork art deco logo by Neil Miller.
-- Flesh out the homepage. Talk about data privacy.
-- Overlay/lightbox-ish-thing on successful form submission to inform user.
-- Calendar presentation needs some CSS help because you can't see the next/prev month buttons.
-- Once send method is selected form changes to have the appropriate fields via AJAX.
Phase3: MAKE IT MO ROBUSTERFIED!
-- Recover-reminders.
-- Create timestamps during validation and check with :satisfies that reminder is after (local-time:now)?
-- Ensure calendar defaults to date of today. Shouldn't need to click if they want today's date.
-- Provide fallback textfield if they don't use JS.
---- :Satisfies function needed in this case, too. "dd-mm-yyyy"
------ Regex OR split-sequence, then count elements and ensure each parses as
------ ints less than 32 and 13 and 9999, respectively. Check length 10 too?
Phase4: MAKE IT MO FEATUROUS!
-- Confirmation email with link to delete reminders?
-- Add support for repeating events? (Daily,Weekly,Monthly,Yearly?)
-- This shouldn't happen but are we sure things are resilient to system clock changes? trivial-timers issue?

OPTIONALS:
Use the string-list and style types to make reminder class stricter?
There's really no need for the with-encrypted-smtp macro. Replace with a function?
